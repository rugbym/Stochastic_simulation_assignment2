Introduction:
- Find subject to relate this report to
- Write an overview of the report with the subjects we touch upon

Theory/methods:
- 
- 

Part 1:
- Review M/M/1 queues theory (done)
- Summarize the process and results in accesible language
- Review M/M/n queues theory 
- Derive average waiting time formula (at least for n=2)
- Summarize the process and results in accesible language

Part 2:

- Implement a DES program using SimPy 
- Simulate arrival and service processes of customers 
- Use exponential distribution for inter-arrival and service times
- Use FIFO scheduling policy
- Use mean and standard deviation of waiting time as performance metrics
- Run simulation for different values of n, λ, and µ, thus varying rho
- Compare results with theoretical predictions
- Use confidence intervals or hypothesis tests for statistical significance

Part 3:

- Modify DES program for SJF scheduling policy
- Prioritize customers with shortest service time
- Compare results with FIFO policy and M/M/1 queue theory

Part 4:

- Modify DES program for different service time distributions
- Use constant service time for M/D/1 and M/D/n queues
- Use hyperexponential distribution for long-tail distribution
- Compare results with M/M/n queues and SJF policy
- Analyze effect of service time distribution on waiting time variability and predictability
